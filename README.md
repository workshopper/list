You can add a suggestion to the list of [requested](https://github.com/nodeschool/workshoppers/issues?labels=status%3Arequested) lessons.

## Contributing

Want to try writing a lesson? There are two modules which can be used to start your lesson:

- [Workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) (and [how to write a workshopper](http://lin-clark.com/blog/2014/07/01/authoring-nodejs-workshopper-lessons))
- [Adventure](https://github.com/substack/adventure)

### Licensing
Both `workshopper` and `adventure` use the permissive MIT/X license so there's no rules about how you license *your* lesson. If you'd like to add a license to your lesson describing how other people can use it but aren't sure which to pick, check out http://choosealicense.com/
